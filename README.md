## Future Enhancements

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Check that the bot is online in Discord (green status)
- Verify the bot has proper permissions in your channel
- Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u hockey-rsvp-bot -f`

**Polls not created automatically:**
- The bot checks once daily at midnight (server time)
- Verify your timezone is set correctly in `.env`
- Manually trigger with `!checkgames` to test

**iCal feed issues:**
- Verify the ICAL_URL is correct
- Check that the URL is accessible from your server
- Test parsing with `!testpoll`
